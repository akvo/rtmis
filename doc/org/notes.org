** validation for option type
*** if parent has value for particular administration_attributes_id then invalidate the children input
so if admin say bantul is "Urban" -> False because; bantul is "Urban" based on it's parent "Jogja"
*** if children has value for particular administration_attributes_id then overide the children value

** the example description
say: administration_id 56 is Bantul, 10 is Jogja
Bantul has 3000 population, it's urban locality, it has 1 duggwell and 2 pipe waters.

** visualisation case
I select Jogja in dropdown, I select type of locality
In case Jogja has 5 Cities, 100 Kecamatan
