** validation for option type
*** if parent has value for particular administration_attributes_id then invalidate the children input
so if admin say bantul is "Urban" -> False because; bantul is "Urban" based on it's parent "Jogja"
*** if children has value for particular administration_attributes_id then overide the children value

** the example description
say: administration_id 56 is Bantul, 10 is Jogja
Bantul has 3000 population, it's urban locality, it has 1 duggwell and 2 pipe waters.

** visualisation case
I select Jogja in dropdown, I select type of locality
In case Jogja has 5 Cities, 100 Kecamatan

* 2024-03-14 List of Effort for Governance Form

** Requirements
- Super Admin and County Admin can add Monitoring Form for Governance Form via Webform
- The Monitoring Form will not goes into Approval Process
- Governance Form can be accessible via Mobile ??

** Required Efforts

*** Monitoring Form Mechanism via Webform

**** Backend Changes

Currently API endpoint for form submission via frontend http://localhost:3000/api/v1/form-pending-data doesn't support monitoring form.

- Currently we have 2 types of form: County (1), National (2). The National form is olny accessible by County
- Batch Process might not be required for the National form, currently when a County Admin submitting a National form, the batch process is happenend, and there's not approver setup for this type of form.
- The backend should responsible to handle POST API with existing UUID parameter
- Backend should also have an endpoint where frontend can get the latest data for a specific UUID, this API will be use for pre-filling the webform.

**** Frontend Changes

- Frontend will responsible to handle pre-filling data for the monitoring form; NP: akvo-react-form can handle pre-filled data already
- Frontend will send submission to the endpoint with optional UUID parameter if it's monitoring submission
- We should think about approval mechanism of National type of Form
